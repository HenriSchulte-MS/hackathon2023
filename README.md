# Hackathon2023: Automate business data lookups with Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel

This projects introduces an AI copilot for Microsoft's internal Sales CRM. It allows users to retrieve account team assignments, e.g., "Who is the Account Executive for Contoso?", and opportunities, e.g., "Are there any Generative AI opportunities with Contoso?" by asking simple natural language questions. This is made possible by utilizing Large Language Models in Azure OpenAI and orchestrating them with Semantic Kernel.
